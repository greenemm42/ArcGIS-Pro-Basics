# ArcGIS Pro Basics — Learning Repository

This repository documents hands-on completion of the **ArcGIS Pro Basics** training using ArcGIS Pro.  
It demonstrates practical GIS workflows, clean project organization, and version-controlled documentation.

---

##  Project Overview

The focus of this project is to:
- Create and manage ArcGIS Pro projects
- Connect and organize GIS data
- Visualize spatial data in both 2D and 3D
- Navigate and link multiple map views
- Document GIS workflows using Markdown and Git

The project uses real earthquake damage data from the **1994 Northridge Earthquake** to explore spatial patterns and terrain relationships.
