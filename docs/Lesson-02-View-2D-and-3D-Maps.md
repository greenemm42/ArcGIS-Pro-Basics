# Lesson – View 2D and 3D Maps

Date: 2025-12-09

---

## Objectives
- Create and manage an ArcGIS Pro project using a standard map template
- Connect external spatial datasets to an ArcGIS Pro project
- Open and explore a preconfigured 2D map
- Navigate spatial data using common 2D map tools
- Open and navigate a 3D scene
- Link 2D and 3D views to synchronize spatial extent and scale

---

## Steps Taken
1. Downloaded and extracted the lesson dataset into a structured project directory.
2. Created a new ArcGIS Pro project using the Map template.
3. Added a folder connection to reference the lesson data.
4. Opened the provided 2D map file and reviewed loaded layers.
5. Navigated the 2D map using pan, zoom, explore, and layer controls.
6. Examined symbology and attributes for earthquake damage and fault data.
7. Added the provided 3D scene file to the project.
8. Navigated the 3D scene using pan, zoom, rotate, tilt, and fly-through controls.
9. Arranged 2D and 3D views side by side.
10. Linked the 2D and 3D views using Center and Scale.
11. Verified synchronized navigation between views.
12. Saved the project and documented results.

## Key Takeaways
- ArcGIS Pro references data rather than copying it into projects.
- 2D and 3D navigation share tools but behave differently.
- Linking views enables synchronized spatial analysis.
- Consistent folder organization simplifies GIS workflows.
