# Lesson 03 — Navigate and Link 2D and 3D Views

## Objectives
- Navigate a 3D scene using ArcGIS Pro navigation controls.
- Compare spatial patterns between 2D and 3D representations.
- Link 2D maps and 3D scenes to synchronize views.

## Steps Taken
1. Opened the 3D scene file (NorthridgeQuake_3D).
2. Navigated the scene using pan, zoom, rotate, and tilt tools.
3. Docked the 2D map and 3D scene side by side.
4. Enabled **Link Views ? Center and Scale**.
5. Verified synchronized navigation between views.
6. Captured a screenshot of the linked views.

## Output
